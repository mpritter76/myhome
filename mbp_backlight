# You must run it as root user or via sudo.
# As a shortcut you could allow to admin users to run via sudo without password
# prompt. To do this you must add sudoers file the next contents:

#   ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/mbp_backlight

# After this you can use this script as follows:
#
#     Increase backlight keyboard:
#           $ sudo mbp_backlight up
#     Decrease backlight keyboard:
#           $ sudo mbp_backlight down
